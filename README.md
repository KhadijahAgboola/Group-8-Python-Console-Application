# Global Holiday Planner
This project combines data analysis, user input processing, and real-time currency conversion to offer personalized travel recommendations by creating  a tool that helps users plan an international holiday based on various criteria, including population, country size, flag color preferences, and real-time exchange rates using data generated form two APIs
The first API returns data about information(such as population, sq. m, flag colour etc) of selected countries. The second API generates the current exchange rate of the selected country in comparison to 1 USD.
